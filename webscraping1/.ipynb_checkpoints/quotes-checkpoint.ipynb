      "Like many people, I seek inspiration in the thoughts and words of others.  So much wisdom is created over a lifetime of experience that I wish people could bottle it up and pass it along directly to others.  One way that wisdom is packaged is in the quotations codified and passed along by authors, scientists, sports figures, and others.  For years, I have kept a collection of quotations that inspire me.  Here are some of my favorite quotes:\n",

      "“Nothing is as vulnerable as entrenched success.” – George Romney\n",
      "“I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.” -- Wayne Gretzky\n",
      "“Sometimes your joy is the source of your smile, but sometimes your smile can be the source of your joy.” -- Thich Nhat Hanh\n",
      "“Whether you think you can or think you can't, you're right.” --Henry Ford\n",
      "“We are not human beings on a spiritual journey. We are spiritual beings on a human journey.”  -- Stephen Covey\n",
